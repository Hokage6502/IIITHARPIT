Publishing Datasets and Versions (Nodejs) 

## Requirements and functionalities:

1. creating version upload UI, with special care as the files might be really large.
2. some kind of version control system integrated.
3. version control UI for easy access to datasets.

## Tech Stack:

1. A MERN stack where the focus is on making intutive UI as versioning can easily get messed up because of high number of versions.
2. React dropzone uploader, to manage upload rate, upload status.
3. UI frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap to make intutive UI work seemlessly with the version control.
4. Currently version control will only be implemented as follows:
    
    a. User will select a file to be uploaded.
    
    b. Fill out a form which contains information like which version this particular upload is, and version id (which we also can generate randomly to ease the process further)
    
    c. List showing version and datasets in react ui.

## Deliverables (weekly):
Week 1: Understand the requirements of the project

Week 2: Develop the required backend for the version management

Week 3: Develop the frontend interface for the project

Week 4: Integrate the frontend and the backend

Week 5: Integrate with other projects


## Projects to collaborate with:

Efficient Download manager. (If download button is to be kept in UI after uploading).
Secure Download. (If download button is to be kept in UI after uploading).
